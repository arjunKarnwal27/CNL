File Directory:

'Auto500Line.ijm' is a macro/tool for the Fiji / imageJ software that automatically creates a horiontal line of length 500 (um) starting from the current cursor position, and extending left / right as the user chooses. 
This file has a few key assumptions:
* The scale factor is .255 um/pixel (51 pixels for 200 um)
* Line desired is perfectly horizontal (angle 0 with the x-axis)

How to Use: 
* first download the 'Auto500Line.ijm' file (found on top right under "..." after selecting 'Auto500Line.ijm' on the left side of current page)
* Move this file into your fiji software by:
* Opening Fiji File Folder - opening macro folder - pasting into macro folder
* In Fiji itself, simply click Plugins -> Macros -> Install -> Select the file

The current file icon is a red #5. The icon must be clicked (darker background than all the other icons) in order to be active.
