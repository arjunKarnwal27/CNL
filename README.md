'Auto500Line.ijm' is a macro for the Fiji / imageJ software that automatically creates a horiontal line of length 500 (um) starting from the current cursor position, and extending left / right as the user chooses. 
This file has a few key assumptions:
* The scale factor is .255 um/pixel (51 pixels for 200 um)
* Line desired is perfectly horizontal (angle 0 with the x-axis)
